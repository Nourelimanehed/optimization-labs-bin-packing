# optimization-labs-bin-packing
An extensive exploration of optimization techniques applied to the bin packing problem, encompassing a wide range of algorithms and methodologies. This repository delves into traditional heuristics and meta-heuristics, alongside advanced hyper-heuristics, offering a comprehensive study of solving the bin packing problem efficiently. Implemented approaches include:

## Heuristics:
- Max-Rest
- Best Fit with HeapQ
- Best Fit Enhanced
## Meta-Heuristics:
### Local Search Methods:
- Hill Climbing
- Simulated Annealing
- Tabu Search
### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
### Genetic Algorithms (GA)
## Hyper-Heuristics: Two Approaches:
- Selection with Perturbation
- Selection with Generation
